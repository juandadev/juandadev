## 🚀 About Me

I'm a frontend developer from Mexico with 5+ years of experience building modern UIs using **React**, **Next.js** and **TypeScript**. I believe the frontend is more than just buttons and forms, it's the layer where humans meet software. And I love making that experience feel amazing.

- ✨ Currently working full-time as a Software Engineer at an IT consultant with a US based client
- 🧠 Obsessed with **developer experience** and clean component libraries
- 🧳 Big fan of open source, creative side-projects, and web performance
- 🎮 Gamer, designer wannabe, sometimes I play guitar too
