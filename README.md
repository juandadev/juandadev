## 🚀 About Me

I'm a frontend developer from Mexico with 5+ years of experience building modern UIs using **React**, **Next.js** and **TypeScript**. I believe the frontend is more than just buttons and forms — it's the layer where humans meet software. And I love making that experience feel amazing.

- ✨ Currently working full-time as a Software Engineer at an IT consultant with a US client
- 🧠 Obsessed with **developer experience** and clean component libraries
- 🧳 Big fan of open source, creative side-projects, and web performance
- 🎮 Gamer, designer wannabe, sometimes I play guitar too
- ⏳ Goal: Staff Engineer & financial freedom before 40

- Built with **Next.js**, **React**, **Tailwind CSS** and **PokéAPI**
- Fully static with an offline-first mindset
- Evolving alongside my frontend skills

## 💡 Fun Facts

- I got into web development after failing a uni class. Best failure of my life.
- Although I studied Computer Systems Engineering with a major in Web development, I still had to enter a bootcamp in 2020 because I wasn't confident enough to land a job by myself.
- I use [inkdrop](https://inkdrop.app) to write my entire life. Been thinking of building my own notes app, too.
